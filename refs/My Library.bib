  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is progressively reshaping the fields of quantitative finance and algorithmic trading. ML tools are increasingly adopted by hedge funds and asset managers, notably for alpha signal generation and stocks selection. The technicality of the subject can make it hard for non-specialists to join the bandwagon, as the jargon and coding requirements may seem out of reach. Machine Learning for Factor Investing: R Version bridges this gap. It provides a comprehensive tour of modern ML-based investment strategies that rely on firm characteristics.  The book covers a wide array of subjects which range from economic rationales to rigorous portfolio back-testing and encompass both data processing and model interpretability. Common supervised learning algorithms such as tree models and neural networks are explained in the context of style investing and the reader can also dig into more complex techniques like autoencoder asset returns, Bayesian additive trees, and causal models.   All topics are illustrated with self-contained R code samples and snippets that are applied to a large public dataset that contains over 90 predictors. The material, along with the content of the book, is available online so that readers can reproduce and enhance the examples at their convenience. If you have even a basic knowledge of quantitative finance, this combination of theoretical concepts and practical illustrations will help you learn quickly and deepen your financial and technical expertise.},

  abstract = {Technical analysis, also known as "charting," has been part of financial practice for many decades, but this discipline has not received the same level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as more traditional approaches such as fundamental analysis. One of the main obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analysis\textemdash the presence of geometric shapes in historical !price charts is often in the eyes of the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to technical pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and apply this method to a large number of U.S. stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness to technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical distribution of daily stock returns to the conditional distribution\textemdash conditioned on specific technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or doublebottoms\textemdash we find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value.},

  abstract = {We apply four machine learning methods to cross-sectional return prediction for hedge fund selection. We equip the forecast model with a set of idiosyncratic features, which are derived from historical returns of a hedge fund and capture a variety of fund-specific information. Evaluating the out-of-sample performance, we find that our forecast method significantly outperforms the four styled HFR Indices in almost all situations. Among the four machine learning methods, we find that deep neural network appears to be overall most effective. Investigating the source of methodological advantage of our method using a case study, we find that cross-sectional forecast outperforms forecast based on time series regression in most cases. Advanced modeling capabilities of machine learning further enhance these advantages. We find that the return-based features lead to higher returns than the benchmark of a set of macro-derivative features, and our forecast method yields best performance when the two sets of features are combined.}
