  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is progressively reshaping the fields of quantitative finance and algorithmic trading. ML tools are increasingly adopted by hedge funds and asset managers, notably for alpha signal generation and stocks selection. The technicality of the subject can make it hard for non-specialists to join the bandwagon, as the jargon and coding requirements may seem out of reach. Machine Learning for Factor Investing: R Version bridges this gap. It provides a comprehensive tour of modern ML-based investment strategies that rely on firm characteristics.  The book covers a wide array of subjects which range from economic rationales to rigorous portfolio back-testing and encompass both data processing and model interpretability. Common supervised learning algorithms such as tree models and neural networks are explained in the context of style investing and the reader can also dig into more complex techniques like autoencoder asset returns, Bayesian additive trees, and causal models.   All topics are illustrated with self-contained R code samples and snippets that are applied to a large public dataset that contains over 90 predictors. The material, along with the content of the book, is available online so that readers can reproduce and enhance the examples at their convenience. If you have even a basic knowledge of quantitative finance, this combination of theoretical concepts and practical illustrations will help you learn quickly and deepen your financial and technical expertise.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel decision support system using a computational efficient functional link artificial neural network (CEFLANN) and a set of rules is proposed to generate the trading decisions more effectively. Here the problem of stock trading decision prediction is articulated as a classification problem with three class values representing the buy, hold and sell signals. The CEFLANN network used in the decision support system produces a set of continuous trading signals within the range 0\textendash 1 by analyzing the nonlinear relationship exists between few popular technical indicators. Further the output trading signals are used to track the trend and to produce the trading decision based on that trend using some trading rules. The novelty of the approach is to engender the profitable stock trading decision points through integration of the learning ability of CEFLANN neural network with the technical analysis rules. For assessing the potential use of the proposed method, the model performance is also compared with some other machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayesian model, K nearest neighbor model (KNN) and Decision Tree (DT) model.},

  abstract = {Technical analysis, also known as "charting," has been part of financial practice for many decades, but this discipline has not received the same level of academic scrutiny and acceptance as more traditional approaches such as fundamental analysis. One of the main obstacles is the highly subjective nature of technical analysis\textemdash the presence of geometric shapes in historical !price charts is often in the eyes of the beholder. In this paper, we propose a systematic and automatic approach to technical pattern recognition using nonparametric kernel regression, and apply this method to a large number of U.S. stocks from 1962 to 1996 to evaluate the effectiveness to technical analysis. By comparing the unconditional empirical distribution of daily stock returns to the conditional distribution\textemdash conditioned on specific technical indicators such as head-and-shoulders or doublebottoms\textemdash we find that over the 31-year sample period, several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value.},

  abstract = {Financial time series forecasting is, without a doubt, the top choice of computational intelligence for finance researchers from both academia and financial industry due to its broad implementation areas and substantial impact. Machine Learning (ML) researchers came up with various models and a vast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a significant amount of surveys exist covering ML for financial time series forecasting studies. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models started appearing within the field, with results that significantly outperform traditional ML counterparts. Even though there is a growing interest in developing models for financial time series forecasting research, there is a lack of review papers that were solely focused on DL for finance. Hence, our motivation in this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review on DL studies for financial time series forecasting implementations. We not only categorized the studies according to their intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex, commodity forecasting, but also grouped them based on their DL model choices, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future for the field by highlighting the possible setbacks and opportunities, so the interested researchers can benefit.},

  abstract = {We apply four machine learning methods to cross-sectional return prediction for hedge fund selection. We equip the forecast model with a set of idiosyncratic features, which are derived from historical returns of a hedge fund and capture a variety of fund-specific information. Evaluating the out-of-sample performance, we find that our forecast method significantly outperforms the four styled HFR Indices in almost all situations. Among the four machine learning methods, we find that deep neural network appears to be overall most effective. Investigating the source of methodological advantage of our method using a case study, we find that cross-sectional forecast outperforms forecast based on time series regression in most cases. Advanced modeling capabilities of machine learning further enhance these advantages. We find that the return-based features lead to higher returns than the benchmark of a set of macro-derivative features, and our forecast method yields best performance when the two sets of features are combined.}

We provide a head-to- head evaluation of GP and SVM applied to this real-world problem, including both a standard comparison of returns on investment and a comparison of both techniques when extended with a "voting" mechanism designed to improve both returns and robustness to volatile markets. Robust- ness is an important additional dimension to this compari- son, since the markets (the environment in which the GP or SVM solution must survive) are dynamic and unpredictable. Our investigation highlights a key difference in the two techniques, showing the superiority of the GP approach for this problem.},

Indices of different asset classes show robust correlations and trading them substantially reduces the spectrum of available assets to choose from. We compare our method with a wide range of algorithms with results showing that our model obtains the best performance over the testing period, from 2011 to the end of April 2020, including the financial instabilities of the first quarter of 2020. A sensitivity analysis is included to understand the relevance of input features and we further study the performance of our approach under different cost rates and different risk levels via volatility scaling.},
